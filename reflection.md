Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
I spoke with Ellie Zdancewic, but we spoke on 9/24 after she had already submitted her assignment so I won't be in the list of people she consulted.
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
I attended TA hours on Tuesday 9/24, 7-9pm.
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
Because I don't yet know the syntax well, my initial impressions are that it's a tad confusing. For example, I found writing a for loop to be much more complicated in Java than it is in Python.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
Ultimately, while it felt to me like there were a lot of differences between Python and Java because I don't have experience with Java, I also recognize that there are a lot of similarities. The basic structures, like loops, exist in a fairly similar format, even if they are expressed differently. This tells me that the buidling blocks are the same for programming in Java, even if the exact lines needed to make something happen are different.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
My main problem was that I felt like I was starting from scratch in learning a lot of Java syntax. As I've only ever used Python before, I found myself forgetting the differences from time to time and getting a little frustrated. I gave this as my advice on the last assignment as well, but my advice to future students is to take advantage of TA hours. They're very helpful!
